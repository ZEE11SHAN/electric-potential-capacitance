            <h2>Electric Potential</h2>
            <p>Electric potential is the amount of electric potential energy per unit charge at a point in a static electric field. It is usually measured in volts. The electric potential \(V\) at a point in space is given by:</p>
            <p>\(V = \frac{U}{q}\)</p>
            <p>where \(U\) is the electric potential energy and \(q\) is the charge.</p>
            <h3>Electric Potential Due to Point Charges</h3>
            <p>The electric potential \(V\) due to a point charge \(q\) at a distance \(r\) is given by:</p>
            <p>\(V = k_e \frac{q}{r}\)</p>
            <h3>Electric Dipole Potential</h3>
            <p>The potential \(V\) due to an electric dipole at a point in space is given by:</p>
            <p>\(V = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{\vec{p} \cdot \hat{r}}{r^2}\)</p>

        <section id="electric-potential-energy">
            <h2>Electric Potential Energy</h2>
            <p>Electric potential energy is the energy a charge has due to its position in an electric field. The potential energy \(U\) of a charge \(q\) at a point where the electric potential is \(V\) is given by:</p>
            <p>\(U = qV\)</p>
            <h3>Potential Energy of a System of Charges</h3>
            <p>For two point charges \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) separated by a distance \(r\), the electric potential energy is given by:</p>

        <section id="equipotential-surfaces">
            <h2>Equipotential Surfaces</h2>
            <p>Equipotential surfaces are surfaces where the electric potential is the same everywhere. Since the electric potential is constant on an equipotential surface, no work is required to move a charge along such a surface.</p>
            <h3>Equipotential Surfaces of Point Charges</h3>
            <p>For a point charge, equipotential surfaces are concentric spheres centered on the charge.</p>

            <p>\(C = \frac{Q}{V}\)</p>
            <h3>Parallel Plate Capacitor</h3>
            <p>The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by:</p>
            <p>\(C = \epsilon_0 \frac{A}{d}\)</p>
            <p>where \(A\) is the area of the plates and \(d\) is the separation between them.</p>
